# Python Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains several projects and scripts developed as part of my Python learning process. Each file represents a mini-project focused on different concepts of the language, from basic logic and data manipulation to object-oriented programming and terminal-based games.

## ðŸš€ Projects Included

Here is a summary of each project:

### 1\. Car Rental System (`locadora.py`)

  * **Description:** A simple command-line interface (CLI) system to manage car rentals.
  * **Features:**
      * Displays a catalog of available cars with their prices.
      * Rents a car for a specified number of days.
      * Returns a rented car.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** List manipulation (`append`, `pop`), `while` and `for` loops, user input (`input`), string formatting, and conditional logic.

### 2\. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (`Tic_tac-toe.py`)

  * **Description:** An implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game to be played in the terminal against a "computer" that makes random moves.
  * **Features:**
      * A 3x3 board displayed in the console.
      * The player enters coordinates (row and column) to make a move.
      * Automatic check for a win, loss, or draw.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** Object-Oriented Programming (use of classes), manipulation of nested lists (matrices), use of the `random` module, and game logic.

### 3\. Snake Game (`jogo_da_cobrinha.py`)

  * **Description:** The classic "Snake" game developed to run directly in the terminal.
  * **Features:**
      * Control the snake using the arrow keys.
      * Random generation of fruits on the screen.
      * Collision detection with the borders and its own body.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** Use of the `curses` library for advanced terminal manipulation, a main game loop, and collision detection logic.

### 4\. Caesar Cipher (`Cifra_de_cesar.py`)

  * **Description:** A tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher method.
  * **Features:**
      * An option to either encode or decode a text.
      * The user provides the text and a numeric "key" for the character shift.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** String manipulation, use of the `string` module, logic with the modulo operator (`%`) to create a wrapping effect on the alphabet, and code modularization into functions.

### 5\. Simple Calculator (`calculadora.py`)

  * **Description:** A command-line calculator that performs the four basic operations, as well as exponentiation and root calculation.
  * **Features:**
      * The user chooses an operation and enters two values.
      * The result is displayed on the screen.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** Use of dictionaries to map operations, `lambda` functions for quick implementations, and basic error handling (division by zero).

### 6\. Prime Number Checker (`checkparidade.py`)

  * **Description:** A script that takes an integer and checks if it is prime or composite.
  * **Features:**
      * If the number is composite, the script shows which numbers it is divisible by.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** Mathematical logic with loops, use of the modulo operator (`%`), and importing functions from other files (`decoradores.py`).

### 7\. Decorator Module (`decoradores.py`)

  * **Description:** This is not a standalone project, but a utility module used by other scripts.
  * **Features:**
      * Provides the `imprimir_centralizado_com_caixa` function, which displays text in the terminal, centered and inside a stylized box.
  * **Concepts demonstrated:** Creation of reusable functions and use of the `os` module to get the terminal size.
